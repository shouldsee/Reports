>>Introduction:
Among the family of stem cells, pluripotent stem cell (PSC) represents the most useful class. The word "pluripotent" means being capable of differentiating into all kinds of functional cells, rendering it promising for modelling disase, testing drugs and regenerative medicine. 

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and Embryonic Stem cells (ESC) are two major classes of PSC's. iPSC is induced from mature somatic cells while ESC is taken from early developing embryo. Such difference leads to controversies on ethnics and on technicalities.

>> Mechanism
iPSC's have been obtained from human fibroblasts, keratinocytes, peripheral blood cells. Such somatic cells are first collected from the host and then induced to express a cocktail of transcription factors, delivered with retroviral/lentiviral transfection. These transcription factors then effect to alter the cellular identity to re-establish pluripotency. The cell culture is then screened for the pluripotency marker, to identify the resultant iPSC's. 

The effect of transcription factors 

As the underlying science is unravelled, the receipe of the cocktail is constantly updating . The discovery of epigenetic markers allows addition of histone deacetylase to improve chromosomal accessibility.

On one hand, one wants to increase the induction efficiency. On the other hand, one wants as little mutation as possible to ensure the iPSC is safe for clinical purpose. For example, shutting down p53 apppear to increase the  efficiency, but at the same increase the mutational rate.
