BIOC3024:

Nuclear Pore complex has an inclusion size. Molecules under this size are free to enter the nucleus without interrogation. Is this really the reality? NPC seems to offer a mean for nucleus to recognise "self".

Life employs an hierachial architecture. Atoms form molecules, molecules form macromols. Such organisation seems spontaneous and border-less. i.e. C and O atoms do not enforce border control in order to form an amino acid. And a macromolecule like a protein does not do so to establish its own identity. In other words, the process of compartmentalisation is not obvious at the small-molecule level. A collection of protein does not amount to self-awareness. The fact that bacteria has a border control, establishes it as a life. It would be interesting to check the permeability of the bacterial cell wall.
